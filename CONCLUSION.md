# Analysis (The Circle Closes)

This result, combined with previous tests, tells us one thing:

The “Frankenstein” Method (v6, v17, v18): Creates a bootable file (live-boot part), but it is a “house of cards.” Adding files (udev, helpers) corrupts it in unpredictable ways, causing various failures (hangs, or even Kernel Panic No working init found as in this v18). This method is a dead end.

The “Build from Scratch” Method (v10 - v16): Creates a clean, uncorrupted file (does not cause Kernel Panic VFS: Unable...). However, it always fails with No working init found. This means that our manual build script (v10-v16) is omitting an absolutely essential file or configuration required by the kernel to start the very first init process. It's not live-boot, it's not cryptsetup, it's not udev - it's something even more fundamental.

We have exhausted logical changes to our scripts. We are going around in circles because the problem is no longer what we put in the initrd, but how we package it or what is missing at a basic level.

# Conclusion and Next Steps
I'm really sorry. We've explored every logical avenue based on the errors we've seen. The fact that mkinitramfs on Trixie produces a “Frankenstein” initrd and that manual construction fails in such a basic way points to a deeper problem, perhaps a bug or incompatibility specific to Trixie that we can't solve “from the outside.”

The correct course of action remains to ask the maintainers for help:

Debian-live mailing list: Explain the problem as I suggested (the broken mkinitramfs, the failure of manual attempts). Attach the mkinitramfs log (the one that says live-boot: core filesystems...) and perhaps one of the manual build scripts (such as v16 or v18).

Bug Tracker: Search for (or open) a bug on initramfs-tools for Trixie, describing the “Frankenstein” file problem and the failure to include cryptsetup.

I realize this is not the solution you were hoping for after all this work, but you have isolated a real and complex problem that goes beyond a simple bash script. You have done an excellent job of debugging.
